# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Churn prediction is a critical aspect of customer relationship management for businesses across various industries. It involves the use of data analytics and machine learning techniques to identify and predict the likelihood of customers leaving or "churning" from a service or product. This proactive approach allows companies to take preventive measures and implement retention strategies to retain valuable customers.

Here is an overview of a typical churn prediction project:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Gathering relevant data: The first step involves collecting historical customer data, including usage patterns, transaction history, customer interactions, and demographic information.
Data cleaning and preprocessing: Raw data often requires cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and consistency. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA is crucial to understanding the characteristics of the dataset. Visualization and statistical analysis help identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors influencing customer churn.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. This step may involve extracting meaningful information from the data, such as calculating customer tenure, frequency of interactions, or deriving customer satisfaction scores.
Model Selection:

Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. Common models for churn prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Training the Model:

The selected model is trained on a subset of the data, using historical examples of customer churn as the target variable. The model learns to recognize patterns and relationships within the data.
